* Git Note
** Update an forked repo on  Github
See [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7244321/how-do-i-update-a-github-forked-repository]]
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results output replace
  # Add the remote, called it "upstream", which is the original repo forked

  git remote add upstream https://github.com/whoever/whatever.git

  # Fetch upstream

  git fetch upstream

  # switch to master

  git checkout master

  # rebase all commit in upstream

  git rebase upstream/master

  # push the new commit

  git push origin master
#+END_SRC

** Move branch pointer to commit
Ususally, we create a branch for some bug fix. If it is a regress issue, we oftern need to rollback to some commit to fix the 
bad commit. In this case, we need to move the branch to another commit
[[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5471174/git-move-branch-pointer-to-different-commit-without-checkout]]

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results output replace
  git branch -f branch-name COMMIT
#+END_SRC

** Track local branch to remote branch
Sometime, we enter the issue =no upstream is configured for master=, It is because of local branch tracking is not configured
If you input ~git pull~, it hints the error
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  peli3@[~/Private/blog]>> git pull                                                         ±[••][master]
  There is no tracking information for the current branch.
  Please specify which branch you want to merge with.
  See git-pull(1) for details.

      git pull <remote> <branch>

  If you wish to set tracking information for this branch you can do so with:

      git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/<branch> master
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results output replace
  git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/master master
#+END_SRC
